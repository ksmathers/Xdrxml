Rewrite sdlclient comm code so that it uses gtk_input_add_full(), and
gtk_idle_add().

Add public/private flags to xdr translation (or perhaps a modality)
   so that private data isn't shipped to the client (like the real weapon
   type, etc.)

Add projectiles / fix ranged weapons
Add a joiner?  Change the wheelwright to a joiner?
check attribute bonuses against DMG
limit AC bonus by armor type
add armor type bonuses per weapon damage type

figure out what to do with gauche.  
- maybe use it for damage when attacker has a critical miss.

race bonuses other than stats
