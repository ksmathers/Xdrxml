<PRE>

	So you've got all the programming talent you could ever want and 
a design to die for but you can't draw a goblin to save your life? Well,
here is a whole load of free graphic tilesets to get you started. 

	These tiles originally were intended for use in the roguelike game
<A HREF="http://crash.ihug.co.nz/~jbarrow">Over</A> by <A HREF="mailto:jbarrow@ihug.co.nz">Jeff Barrow</A>. He's kindly agreed to let others developing their
own roguelike use the Over tileset. They've been hacked up into 320x200
256 colour screens in Gif format. 

	Right. These tiles are free but if you're thinking of making money
with them, think again. No profit is to be made in conjunction with these
tiles. Other than that, use them how you please. If you do decide to use 
the tiles in one of your projects, a mention of their creator is required
(me, Darren Hebden, you know, keeper of RLNews and all that).

	I'll be adding to the tiles over time. Anything that comes into my
mind, all styles and settings. I'm also open to suggestions or requests
so if you've got something in mind, drop me a note. If its a specific 
monsters, weapon, etc. please include some kind of description.

	When some new tiles are added to a set, I'll update the image name
and mention it in the RLNews pages. In some cases, like the buildings
and outside tiles, I'll be detailing how the tiles were 'intended' to be
put together to form houses, bridges, etc. 

	Other than that, go get them and have fun. And remember to tell me
about any new projects you begin.
</PRE>
