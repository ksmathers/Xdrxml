Prerequisites:

   libxml2
   ======= 

   Get and install libxml2 from http://www.xmlsoft.org.  This library
   is a very good, fast, and small C implementation of DOM, XPath,
   and XPointer.
   
   The 'libhistory' and 'libreadline' libraries are also used by libxml,
   but will probably already be on your system.  Redhat 7 includes more
   recent versions of these two libraries than the RPMs on ftp.gnome.org,
   so if you are using Redhat 7 you'll probably be best off compiling 
   'libxml2' from source.

To Build:

    dr1server
    =========

    $ make depend && make

    The result is the program 'dr1server' which is the server side of 
    Dragon's Reach

To Run:

    Run the dr1server from the shell prompt.  For a client you can 
    connect to localhost port 2300:

    server
    ======

    $ dr1server
    3: Server ready...

    client
    ======

    $ telnet localhost 2300
    Login:

    The server saves player data to files with names like 
    'login-password.xml' in the current directory.
