Prerequisites:

   libxml2
   ======= 

   Get and install libxml2 from http://www.xmlsoft.org.  This library
   is a very good, fast, and small C implementation of DOM, XPath,
   and XPointer.
   
   The 'libhistory' and 'libreadline' libraries are also used by libxml,
   but will probably already be on your system.  Redhat 7 includes more
   recent versions of these two libraries than the RPMs on ftp.gnome.org,
   so if you are using Redhat 7 you'll probably be best off compiling 
   'libxml2' from source.

   sdl
   ===

   Get and install the SDL graphics gaming library from www.libsdl.org.
   With Redhat 7, I just installed the SDL and SDL_devel RPMs for version
   1.2.0 of the library.  The code isn't backward compatible with 1.1 so
   you will have to get 1.2 from the network.

   sdl_ttf
   =======

   Truetype font library for SDL.  You can find this library on the
   'library' page at www.libsdl.org.  Build and install.

   freetype
   ========

   SDL_ttf currently only supports the version 1.x series of Freetype.  You
   can download freetype 1.3.1 from www.freetype.org, or just install the
   devel package from the second binary disk if you are using Redhat 7.

To Build:

    dr1server
    =========

    $ make depend && make

    The result is the program 'dr1server' which is the server side of 
    Dragon's Reach

To Run:

    Run the dr1server from the shell prompt.  For a client you can 
    connect to localhost port 2300:

    server
    ======

    $ dr1server
    3: Server ready...

    client
    ======

    $ telnet localhost 2300
    Login:

    The server saves player data to files with names like 
    'login-password.xml' in the current directory.

    sdlclient
    =========

    The custom client test code is in the sdlclient subdirectory.
    Feel free to try it out, but it isn't yet connected to the 
    server.
