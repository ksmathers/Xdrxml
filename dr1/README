Prerequisites:

   libxml2
   ======= 

   Get and install libxml2 from http://www.xmlsoft.org.  This library
   is a very good, fast, and small C implementation of DOM, XPath,
   and XPointer.
   
   The 'libhistory' and 'libreadline' libraries are also used by libxml,
   but will probably already be on your system.  Redhat 7 includes more
   recent versions of these two libraries than the RPMs on ftp.gnome.org,
   so if you are using Redhat 7 you'll probably be best off compiling 
   'libxml2' from source.

To Build:

    dr1
    ===

    $ make depend && make

    The result is the program 'dr1' which is a test driver for the game
    libraries.
