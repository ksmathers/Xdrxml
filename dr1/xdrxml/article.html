<h2>
Mapping Objects to XML using XDR</h2>

<h3>
Kevin Smathers</h3>
Forward and backward compatiblity between web-services is one of the most
important, and the most challenging technical aspect of interoperable web
services. Where there is no control over when people will upgrade their
clients or services and those services can be distributed broadly over
the Internet, only loosely coupled service/client interactions will be
able to adapt. In this paper I look at how object/stream technologies of
the past can be adapted to meet the needs of loosely coupled object/XML
translations, greatly simplifying the work of creating a document interface
without giving up the benefits of loose coupling.
<p>XDR (for External Data Representation) is the set of serialization routines
the Sun provided with Sun RPC when the unix network filesystem was first
released. XDR is written in C, but uses the OO abstraction of a stream
to move structures to and from serialized form.
<p>[Why C in this age of Java and C++? Although I've been doing OOD for
almost ten years now, and have worked with either C++ or Java for all of
that time, neither language in my opinion is suitable for library code.
Whereas C is readily callable from C++, XSLT, Perl, Python, PHP, Fortran,
Java, and a host of other languages, C++ libraries are only useful to other
C++ programmers, and the same goes for Java. C may not be pleasant to use
to implement OO designs, but it is more portable across languages than
any other language I can think of.]
<p>For example the following structure would be serialized with the xdr
function shown below it. Substructures are broken down into further substructures
until eventually you get to basic data types for which XDR provides standard
methods for serializing the basic types into network byte-order streams.
<pre>
<hr WIDTH="100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct Player {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; char *name;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct Location loc;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool_t xdr_Player( XDR *xdrs, struct Player *p) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (!xdr_wrapstring( xdrs, &amp;p->name)) return FALSE;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (!xdr_Location( xdrs, &amp;p->loc)) return FALSE;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return TRUE;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre>

<hr WIDTH="100%">While working on a game library that saved persistent
objects to disk I recently looked into XDR again, but this time to test
out some ideas I've had about XML. The goal of XML is to decouple internal
and external representation, so using serialization techniques would seem
to contradict the most important features of XML. But after writing a few
dozen XML serialization methods I've noticed, as I'm sure you have, that
the main part of the serialization is based on the same old stream techniques
that we've always used for object/stream serialization.
<p>The only part that is completely new to XML is when pulling apart an
XML document you search below a particular node for data that will satisfy
a particular part of the object whereas in object data streams you simply
insist that the data be received and deserialized in the same order it
was sent.
<p>What I've experimented with then, is writing an XDR stream that rather
than reading directly from a file with elements all placed in a specific
and required order, reads from a DOM tree and searches for the node that
will next be deserialized. As a result the objects being read are pleasantly
immune to extra data in the XML source (data for example that was written
by a more recent version of the game library) providing a degree of forward
compatibility; and with some defaulting of missing data can also automatically
upgrade older XML sources to the new objects in a more recent library.
<p>If you haven't already, go get the Gnome XML library from www.xmlsoft.org.
This is a superb and very fast XML library in C with support for DOM, XPath,
XPointer, and XSLT. Sun RPC with XDR is included in the GNU libc project
at http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/ included with all Linux distributions,
and DCE RPC and Microsoft D/COM use similar libraries.
<p>Several types of stream are already included with Sun RPC. The xdrmem_create()
function initializes a stream that sends its output to a buffer, while
xdrstdio_create() creates a stream that will read or write a FILE as defined
in 'stdio.h'. Adding a new stream type is as simple as defining a new xdr_ops
structure with function pointers to the basic data type serialization functions.
In xdrxml.c I define the stream as follows.
<pre>
<hr WIDTH="100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct xdr_ops xdrxml_ops = {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;xdrxml_getlong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;xdrxml_putlong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;xdrxml_getbytes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;xdrxml_putbytes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;xdrxml_getpostn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;xdrxml_setpostn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;xdrxml_inline,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;xdrxml_destroy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;xdrxml_getint32,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;xdrxml_putint32
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</pre>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Each function in the table represents a basic data type
so that higher level xdr functions like xdr_Player shown above can ultimately
be implemented in terms of an underlying stream. For xml output to be prettier
it would be useful to add a new function pointer to this virtual function
table, but in the current implementation I've just added a new method xdrxml_wrapstring()
that itself distinguishes between XML streams and legacy streams.
<p>[The xdrxml library is a part of the open source Dragon's Reach project
on Sourceforge at http://dr1.sourceforge.net, where you can find all of
the code presented in this article.]
<p>In addition to the stream functions we also have to add new method calls
to all of the xdr serialization functions to correctly annotate where in
the DOM tree we are working. Three new functions have been added for xdr
functions to call. These are:
<pre>
<hr WIDTH="100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool_t xdr_push_note( XDR* xdrs, char* note);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool_t xdr_pop_note( XDR* xdrs);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void xdr_attr( XDR* xdrs, char* attr);</pre>

<hr WIDTH="100%">The first and second calls respectively start and complete
a node in the XML tree under which other nodes will be placed in a hierarchy
matching the structure hierarchy. Without these calls the XML tree will
be flat. The last call sets an attribute name so that a basic data type
that is being converted can appear in a document leaf-node with a name
that matches the structure element. Without this call all nodes would be
named by their data-type only.
<p>The earlier example of serializing a Player object thus becomes:
<pre>
<hr WIDTH="100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool_t xdr_Player( XDR *xdrs, struct Player *p) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* serialize a Player object with annotations */

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xdr_attr( xdrs, "name");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (!xdrxml_wrapstring( xdrs, &amp;p->name)) return FALSE;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (!xdr_push_note( xdrs, "loc")) return FALSE;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (!xdr_Location( xdrs, &amp;p->loc)) return FALSE;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xdr_pop_note( xdrs);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return TRUE;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre>

<hr WIDTH="100%">The following code snippet excercises this xdr routine.
The value 'XDR_ENCODE' is one of three modes that XDR defines. Encoding
means taking and object and writing it to a stream. The value XDR_DECODE
would read data from the stream and create an object, while XDR_FREE runs
through the object tree performing a deep free() of the object. Below the
code snippet is the XML printed to 'player.xml'.
<pre>
<hr WIDTH="100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int main( int argc, char **argv) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XDR xdrs;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct Player bob = { "Bob", { 10, 49 }};
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xdr_xml_create( &amp;xdrs, "player.xml", XDR_ENCODE);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xdr_push_note( &amp;xdrs, "bob");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xdr_Player( &amp;xdrs, &amp;bob);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xdr_pop_note( &amp;xdrs);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xdr_destroy( &amp;xdrs);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;bob>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;name>Bob&lt;/name>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;loc>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;x value="0xa"/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;y value="0x31"/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/loc>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;bob></pre>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Thus far there has been nothing particularly exciting.
You get an XML document out that is reasonably well structured and formatted,
but the real challenge is in reading a structure that doesn't match the
output exactly. Suppose for example that a new 'health' attribute is added
to Player to represent how close they are to death. By adding two more
lines to xdr_Player the code now supports the enhanced Player object. If
your code ignored the error generated by xdr_push_note when the xdr operation
is XDR_DECODE then your function would also be able to handle changes to
the class structure.
<pre>

<hr WIDTH="100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool_t xdr_Player( XDR *xdrs, struct Player *p) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* serialize a Player object with annotations */

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xdr_attr( xdrs, "name");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (!xdrxml_wrapstring( xdrs, &amp;p->name)) return FALSE;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (!xdr_push_note( xdrs, "loc")) return FALSE;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (!xdr_Location( xdrs, &amp;p->loc)) return FALSE;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xdr_pop_note( xdrs);

+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xdr_attr( xdrs, "health");
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (!xdr_int( xdrs, &amp;p->health)) return FALSE;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return TRUE;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Reading new and old files using the same xdr routine is
done by searching the DOM tree created when the file is loaded. When the
xdr operation is XDR_DECODE then the xdr_push_note() function performs
a breadth first search of the DOM tree to find a node with the same name.
xdr_pop_note() marks the node consumed so that future searches won't return
to the same node of the tree (as for example when serializing an array
of similar objects.)
<p>The xdr_attr() function sets up an attribute so that a later call to
deserialize one of the basic data types will be able to find a leaf node
of the same name (which is immediately marked as consumed.) If a leaf node
by the same name can't be found, the basic data type is initialized to
zero (or an empty string) so that missing nodes can be ignored ensuring
backward compatibility.
<p>One reason that most people are unfamiliar with XDR is that although
it is widely used, most programmers just define their structures in an
interface definition file and use the 'rpcgen' program or a similar generator
to convert those interfaces into XDR serialization and other functions.
<p>As with XDR, all of the methods of the xdrxml serialization functions
can be derived directly from the structure definition, so one can imagine
a new version of 'rpcgen' that will eventually make hand-coding XML tree
walking functions a thing of the past, all without giving up the flexibility,
the forward and backward compatibility of XML.
<p>In future work on the xdrxml library I plan to add an XML friendlier
replacement for xdr_union (for handling discriminated unions) and other
variant data structures like xdr_reference which should be altered for
XML to encode the discriminant instead of the structure size since XML
handles sizing automatically.
